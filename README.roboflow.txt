It includes 6041 images.
Gg are annotated in YOLO v5 PyTorch format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* 50% probability of vertical flip
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 13 percent of pixels
